        <div class="container bg-light rounded text-left text-dark m-3">
          <h1>Who we are</h1>
          <p>We are a competitive science team from South Brunswick, NJ. Our team consists of around 50 devoted, hardworking students. Our students come from various backgrounds, but we are ultimately a family held together by a mutual love and passion for science. </p>
          <h1>What we do</h1>
          <p>Our team competes in 23 events in groups of 2-3 students, with rules and standards set forth by the <a href="https://soinc.org>National Science Olympiad</a>. Events cover specific, specialized topics in various fields such as chemistry, biology, physics, engineering, and inquiry/nature of science. Students will engage in exciting activities, such as building bottle rockets, airplanes, or even taking tests in topics such as astronomy or fossils. Our season lasts from September through March, where students will work on their events and attend various competitions. In the course of a season, our students will compete in official Regional and State level tournaments, as well as invitationals hosted by colleges and universities such as Yale, Princeton, and UPenn. </p>
          <h1>Why we do it</h1>
          <p>Besides being fun, Science Olympiad is more of an experience than just an activity. Students will develop essential skills required in the workforce, such as teamwork and leadership. Furthermore, students will develop problem solving skills and scientific awareness. The world runs on science, and Science Olympiad empowers students to become the leaders of tomorrow. </p>
